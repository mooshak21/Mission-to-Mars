# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
My goal for this project is to dynamically scrape information from multiple websites and input that information onto my own site. To do this, I used Splinter to automate browser clicks to obtain the specific elements I wanted, BeautifulSoup to parse through HTML elements to find desired objects (images, index tags, etc.), MongoDB to store article titles and image URLs,  and Flask to host the website with all of the scraped information.
